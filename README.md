# Badminton Scorekeeper
I made this project during the learning of Web Development Course
I used the <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a> CSS Framework

## Features
* Supports win-by-two (deuce) rule for 11 point and 21 point games.
* Different game length.
* Score resets automatically when you switch game length.
